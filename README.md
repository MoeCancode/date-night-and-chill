# Date Night and Chill

<br>

We created a fun webpage that implements multiple APIs in order to generate random things to do on a date. Users can plan a nice and unique date by getting arbitrary suggestions for various things on our app.

Who would this program be suited for? This program is available for interested parties who are looking for boosting their effectiveness when it comes to choosing interesting new activities. Tired of your Tinder Date calling you boring? Spark the tinderbox within his or her eyes with this program today!

    As a user, I would like a simple interface that is easy to work with and when I click on a start button, I am presented with inputs that will take in my date selections.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Working

This page is constructed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript and it features usage of jQuery and various APIs to create a unique random date idea. 

There are comments added throughout the files that specify what each part of the code does.

Here is a list of some of the work done to get this app running:

- Utilized several 3rd parties APIs.
- Made use of multiple independant Javascript files to make a webpage modular and easily workable with multiple people working on a website at the same time.
- Utilized Materialize CSS to create a professional appearance on the page.
- Explored the contents of data objects returned by APIs to get random values.

Submit buttons are disbled until a choice is generated so that the user does not accidentally skip over any category.

In order to make the application more practical, a generate message button can be clicked to take all the choices selected by the user and generate a nice message that can be copied and sent to the user's significant other.
